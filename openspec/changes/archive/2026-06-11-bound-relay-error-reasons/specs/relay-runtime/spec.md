## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Testable bounded relay rejection reasons
The relay runtime SHALL expose integration-test coverage proving malformed peer messages receive bounded secret-safe relay error and audit reasons.

#### Scenario: Runtime rejects malformed protocol with bounded reason
- **WHEN** integration tests send malformed protocol input to a registered peer connection
- **THEN** the sender receives a bounded relay error reason and the remaining peer receives no forwarded protocol message

#### Scenario: Runtime audit omits malformed payload details
- **WHEN** the relay audits the malformed protocol rejection
- **THEN** the audit reason and detail do not contain the raw malformed message contents
