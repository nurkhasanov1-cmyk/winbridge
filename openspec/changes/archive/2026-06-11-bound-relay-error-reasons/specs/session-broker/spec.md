## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Message schema validation
The relay and agents SHALL validate protocol envelopes before accepting or forwarding messages, and relay rejection errors for malformed protocol input SHALL use bounded secret-safe reasons.

#### Scenario: Invalid protocol message
- **WHEN** a peer sends malformed JSON or an unknown protocol message
- **THEN** the receiver rejects the message and emits an audit/error event without forwarding it as trusted data

#### Scenario: Malformed protocol rejection reason is bounded
- **WHEN** the relay rejects malformed JSON or schema-invalid protocol input
- **THEN** the peer-facing relay error and audit reason MUST NOT include raw protocol payloads, parser internals, tokens, pairing codes, credentials, keystrokes, screenshots, screen contents, or full secrets
