## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Host workflow audit file persistence
The host shell SHALL persist local development audit records for host-generated workflow `audit-event` messages when an audit sink is configured. When an audit sink is configured, the host shell MUST successfully write the matching local audit record before sending the associated host authorization decision, authorization state, permission revoke, session control, or protocol `audit-event` message for that audited workflow action.

#### Scenario: Host approval audit is persisted
- **WHEN** the host shell is configured with an audit sink and explicitly approves a visible authorization request
- **THEN** it writes schema-valid audit records for approval and visible activation using the host actor, session id, action, outcome, and secret-safe detail metadata

#### Scenario: Host denial audit is persisted
- **WHEN** the host shell is configured with an audit sink and explicitly denies an authorization request
- **THEN** it writes a schema-valid denied audit record without raw denial reason text

#### Scenario: Host lifecycle audit is persisted
- **WHEN** the host shell emits revocation, pause, resume, termination, or expiration workflow audit-events
- **THEN** it writes matching schema-valid audit records with the same event ids, actions, outcomes, and secret-safe details

#### Scenario: Agent shell audit file details are secret-safe
- **WHEN** host workflow audit records are persisted with private host display-name, viewer display-name, lifecycle-reason, pairing-code, signal-payload, or protocol-payload marker values present elsewhere in the workflow
- **THEN** persisted details MUST NOT contain raw tokens, raw pairing codes, credentials, display names, signal payloads, raw protocol payloads, keystrokes, screenshots, screen contents, or raw private reason text

#### Scenario: Received protocol payloads are not persisted as workflow audit
- **WHEN** the agent shell receives arbitrary protocol messages or non-protocol text
- **THEN** it does not persist those raw payloads through the host workflow audit sink

#### Scenario: Audit sink failure is surfaced
- **WHEN** the configured host workflow audit sink fails to write a record
- **THEN** the host shell surfaces the failure instead of silently dropping the audit record

#### Scenario: Denial is not sent when denial audit persistence fails
- **WHEN** the host shell is configured with an audit sink, explicitly denies an authorization request, and the matching audit write fails
- **THEN** it MUST surface the sanitized runtime failure before sending the denial decision or denial audit-event

#### Scenario: Lifecycle update is not sent when lifecycle audit persistence fails
- **WHEN** the host shell is configured with an audit sink and a delayed revocation, pause, resume, termination, or expiration audit write fails
- **THEN** it MUST surface the sanitized runtime failure before sending the associated permission revoke, session control, authorization state, or lifecycle audit-event message
