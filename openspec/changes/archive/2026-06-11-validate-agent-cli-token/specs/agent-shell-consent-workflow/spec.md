- **THEN** the value MUST be either `true` or `false`

#### Scenario: Invalid permission option is rejected

- **THEN** it exits through bounded usage handling before sending any protocol message

#### Scenario: Invalid identifier option is rejected

- **THEN** it exits through bounded usage handling before connecting to the relay or sending any protocol message

#### Scenario: Invalid display name option is rejected
- **WHEN** the agent shell is started with an empty, whitespace-only, or oversized `--name` value
- **THEN** it exits through bounded usage handling before connecting to the relay or sending any protocol message

#### Scenario: Blank token option is rejected

#### Scenario: Blank audit log path option is rejected
