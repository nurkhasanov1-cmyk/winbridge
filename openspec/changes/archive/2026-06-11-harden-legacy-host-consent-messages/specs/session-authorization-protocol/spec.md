## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Legacy host consent message permission-scope invariants
The protocol SHALL reject malformed legacy `host-consent-required` and `host-consent-decision` messages that carry empty, duplicate, or fail-open permission scopes.

#### Scenario: Legacy consent request lacks permissions
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-required` message has no requested permissions
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message before it can be forwarded or processed

#### Scenario: Legacy consent request includes duplicate permissions
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-required` message includes duplicate requested permissions
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message so requested scope remains unambiguous

#### Scenario: Legacy consent approval lacks grants
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-decision` message is approved but has no granted permissions
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message because approval must carry a non-empty grant scope

#### Scenario: Legacy consent approval includes duplicate grants
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-decision` message is approved with duplicate granted permissions
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message so granted scope remains unambiguous

#### Scenario: Legacy consent denial carries grants
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-decision` message is denied but includes granted permissions
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message and preserves deny-by-default behavior

#### Scenario: Legacy consent denial lacks reason
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-decision` message is denied without a reason
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message so denial remains explicit and auditable

#### Scenario: Legacy consent denial has blank reason
- **WHEN** a `host-consent-decision` message is denied with a whitespace-only reason
- **THEN** the protocol schema rejects the message so denial remains explicit and auditable
